Simple BMI calculator designed in Apple style when everything is done in the back-end and only the result is printed on the screen.


Step by step how i start and launch my calculator.js:

1. If you don't have nodemon like an easy node.js started i would rather recommend you to install it it will help a lot when doing changes. (or else do use node when i'm using nodemon)

2. Via terminal go to the directory of the files that you will download from here. (on mac use cd command and navigate to the directory path) Make sure you have every file unzipped and ready.

3. I use $npx nodemon calculator.js (when i'm already navigated to the directory. in the terminal a message : "server started on port 3000" should appear.

4. After getting that message you are set and ready to open the working site. Go to Chrome and type the "localhost:3000" on a new tab and the site should be working.

5. Thanks for your time opening and testing my page, i hope you like it.
